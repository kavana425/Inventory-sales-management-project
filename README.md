📦📊 Inventory & Sales Management Dashboard – Power BI

I built an Inventory & Sales Management Dashboard using Power BI to analyze and track stock levels, sales performance, and product movement in real time. This project helped transform raw data into clear, actionable business insights.

🔍 Key Highlights

✨ Real-time view of current stock, low-stock alerts & reorder levels
📈 Visual analysis of sales trends, monthly revenue & growth
🏷 Product-wise & category-wise top and slow-moving items
🛠 Built using Power Query for data cleaning & DAX for calculations
🎨 Interactive visuals with slicers, drill-through, and a clean UI
📉 Inventory aging & performance insights for better decision-making
